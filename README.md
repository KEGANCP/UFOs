### Project Overview
<p align="center">
  My primary goal was to create a webpage to show a collection of reported UFO's sightings across the world, utilizing the image below outlining the desired layout. Within the webpage I wanted to generate a search feature to execute and collect data within specific desired criteria. I was able to generate all desired funtions by utlizing the following tools.

### Tools Utilized:
    - HTML
    - Javascript
    - Bootstrap

## Project Summary
<p align="center">
  The execution of any specific filter works great and will populate the data in the table just to the right of the filters, only showing data to the specific criteria that was filtered. This webpage will work great for anyone researching prior/dated reported UFO sightings, but there is a drawback; because this data is being pulled from a static file set, there will never be any new additions to our list of reported sightings.
  
  For future development of this tool, I would recommend utilizing a live dataset continuously being updated with current sightings, and potentially utilizing a scrap tool to pull fresh data regularly. Another feature that would be beneficial, is having an option to broaden the filters a bit. Currently you must be precise with your filter, but there may be a need to have multiple states selected, or a date range for example.
